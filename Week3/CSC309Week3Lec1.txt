java script this lecture

a scripting language that make the web more dynamnic(?)

JavaScript has nothing to do with java actually, well, little to do

ECMA ES is the standard and JS implement that standard

ES6 that's what we are talking about. (Learning about)



JAVAScript language
in JS we can declare variable using 'var'
var a;
a = 4;

or: var a =4;
.js file can be linked to html by <script> tag

var scope
	var can be used in it's scope functions.
	And a funciton can use it's scope's var

Because all the var's declaration and definaition are seperate
See more details in "Var Hoisting"

var in a function and var global is not the same thing(?) Strange :(


two new ways to declare the new var in the JS
let and const
This two have block scope. Only the current block can access to it.

Rule : in this course plz use const unless you know you will need to re-assigned it later.
